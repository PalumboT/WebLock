WebLock
=======

### Description
Weblock is a project of a electronical lock connected to the Internet. The objective of the project was to provide source codes and manufacture plans of the lock to allow easy reproduction by users with only some knowledge in the area of programming and electronics. The project is oriented solutions simpler and provides concise explanations to make your own model.

### How does it work
Weblock lock operates with a RFID reading system. Users put their own badge on the antenna of the reader. The lock sends the identifier of the key to a web server, and opens the door following the response. The access rights of users are managed in a database that can be administered through a web interface.

### Arduino
This project was carried out with an Arduino Ethernet, but it can be reproduced with an Arduino Uno and an Ethernet Shield without making any changes to the source code. 

Arduino products were chosen because they provide an excellent platform for beginners in the field.

### License
The project is under WTFPL license.
